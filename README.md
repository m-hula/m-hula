<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Hula</h1>
<h3 align="center">Masters student at the University of Sheffield, studying Data Science

## I have experience using R studio to create regression models, run PCAs, and visualise data using ggplot. During my Masters degree I will also gain experience with Python and SPSS. Projects using R studio include the repositories "Intro to data science" and "Data visualisation" as well as a previous project where I created a PCA comparing animal skulls. My interests are creating prediction models and PCAs related to either sports or biological related such as genetics and animals.
